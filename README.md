# etch-a-sketch

This project is build following the assignment given by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

## Description
A very simple paint application, with basic painting functionality. The goal of the project was to revisit javaScript syntax, along DOM manipulation, event listening and basic CSS styling.

The grid is calculated run-time, based on the viewport of the user, and algined using flexbox, according to the subject requirements. Because of this, in case of resizing the image will be disintegrated.
